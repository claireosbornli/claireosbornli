<p>SAY HI</p>
<p>I take commissions! You can send me an email at clairemosbornli@gmail.com. I can also be contacted on <a href="https://twitter.com/claireosbornli">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>
You can leave me a note on my <a href="https://www.yourworldoftext.com/~worldscollide/">Wall of Text</a>.
<p>
I'm very devoted to my <a href="https://letterboxd.com/thealiencorn/">Letterboxd</a>, but I almost never leave written reviews.
<p>
I've been playing around with websites recently: like this <a href="https://command-shift-4.neocities.org/">screenshot garden</a> I made using Everest Pipkin's <a href="https://screenshot-garden.neocities.org/build-your-own.html">template + tutorial</a>. It's a work in progress: I have a new laptop so I don't have much of a collection of screenshots yet to contribute to it! But like a garden, it grows. 
<p>
I also frequently tend to my <a href="https://www.are.na/claire-li">are.na</a>. A tool called a <a href="https://scoby.page/">Scoby</a> allows me to convert are.na channels into websites; you can find all the Scobies I've made <a href="https://www.are.na/claire-li/scobies-i-ve-made">here</a>.
