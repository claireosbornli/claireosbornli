<p>HI THERE!</p>
<br>
<img src="images/me.gif" width="200">
<br>
<p>I am a writer (b. 1999) living on Gadigal land with an interest in art, videogames and digital culture. In 2022 I received my BA Honours at the University of Melbourne in Art History. I'm currently studying a Master of Digital Communications and Culture at the University of Sydney. My work has appeared on the ACMI and NGA website and in Cordite, ArtsHub, GamesHub and Memo Review.</p>
<p>Recently, I've been guest editor of Artlink's <a href="https://www.artlink.com.au/issues/4430/hyphen/">Warltati / Summer issue of 2024</a> and a participant in the NGA's <a href="https://nga.gov.au/learn/young-people/national-young-writers-program/young-writers-digital-residency/">Young Writers Digital Residency</a>. </p>
<p>For a few years now I've been host of ACMI's <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/women-non-binary-gamers-club/">Women and Non-Binary Gamers Club</a>.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that I live and work on the stolen lands of the Gadigal people of the Eora nation and pay my respects to their elders past and present. This always was and always will be Aboriginal land.</p>
